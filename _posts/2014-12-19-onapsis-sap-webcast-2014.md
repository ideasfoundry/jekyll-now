title: Onapsis SAP webcast 2014 Malware, Exploits and SAP Security Trends
---

The webcast had some interesting numbers like time to deploy patches is ~6mths and Heartbleed, Shellshock and Poodle affected SAP platform. I was hoping that they would give a summary about kind of vulnerabilities and their impact as not everyone has access to SAP notes. CVSS doesn’t help at all.
Also, I haven’t seen any malware in the wild that specifically targets SAP NW. Zombie Zero used SMB for the attack and trageted ERP systems but is it SAP specific?
TrojanSpy:Win32/Gamker.A is a general banking and information-stealing trojan. One of the process is saplogon.exe among others.
